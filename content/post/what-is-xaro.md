Ever since I was a little kid I've played lots of games on the Super Nintendo. It's my favorite console and it contains all my favorite games such as Super Mario World and Contra 3. But there is one game that's my all time favorite. And that would be Super Metroid. This is a very influencial title and it will show some similarities and play style.

Although inspired by Metroid doesn't make it an homage or copy. Xaro is going to be my ideal adventure/exploration game. A game that you can play multiple times while still finding new things and different ways to play. With the ability to play the game out of order is to encourage speed running techniques to be used along with advanced movement to make you feel really cool when you're exploring the world of Xaro.
